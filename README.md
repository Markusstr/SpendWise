# SpendWise

This project is done in 48 hours at [Junction 2019](https://2019.hackjunction.com/) hackathon. The idea behind our project was to create an application that helps people make better purchase decisions when shopping online.

The application estimates how long consumers use a certain product and then shows how much that product would cost per week. With this information users can make better decisions when comparing expensive products that last longer and their cheaper alternatives.

### Front-end

This GitHub repository has the frontend of our application. We decided to make an Android application as the front-end because we had experience from Android development.
To use our application, you need to paste the product URL in the app or use the browser's share feature to directly share the link with our application.


### Back-end

The backend is a Node.js server with a MongoDB database. We use a Python datacrawler to get product information from the user's website and search user data for that product from our MongoDB database.
